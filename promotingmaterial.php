                    Opportunity for writers is at the apex of growth for the 50+ broadcasting networks in the U.S. The growth of commercial
                    television stations airing in the United States grew to a staggering 231% rate during the recent seven-year period. The
                    appetite for original TV programming has created intense competition between the networks. TV networks exhibit an
                    insatiable desire to discover new material from writers who can appeal to audiences in the U.S. and abroad.
                    </p>

                    <p class="writer_side_para">
                    While the opportunity for new writers is at its highest level, most production companies do not accept unsolicited
                    material from individual writers. Having a literary agent and being affiliated with a known company with industry ties is
                    nearly essential if your material is going to be read. Statistics confirm that individuals have a 93% Advantage to be read
                    and discovered when being promoted by a 3 rd . party business that specializes in the service of their needs.
