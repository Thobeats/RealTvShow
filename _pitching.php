                    When appropriate, a play on words or catchy word title can elevate initial interest.
                    The logline defines in two to three sentences what the show will be about. It reveals the genre and reality type such as a formatted or docuseries type show. 
                    It needs to be concise and motivate the reader to want to know more.

                                            <li>: Team up with an established reality show producer. Look for a producer who’s already produced reality shows 
                                            similar to the one you’re pitching. If you’re new to the industry and you don’t know any producers, pay to attend 
                                            a conference like the National Association of Television Program Executives that takes place annually in Miami,

                                        or the annual RealScreen Summit in Washington, DC. 
                                        Attending a conference with high-level TV executives can cost over $1,000 (€843), so you'll want to make sure you're 
                                        prepared if you decide to take this route. Make sure your pitch package is all put together and consider having multiple 
                                        ideas to pitch. 
                                        At the conference, attend sessions hosted by network executives you're interested in networking with, and introduce yourself 
                                        after the session. Have cards with your contact information on them that you can hand out to prospective buyers.

                                        <li>: Pitch directly to the networks. If you have an agent, have them arrange a meeting between you and some network executives. 
                                        Choose a network you could see your show airing on; if your

                                        network that airs home-improvement-style shows. Come to the meeting prepared with your pitch package (short tape, write up, 
                                        headshots) and convince the network execs that your show would be a hit. If your show centers around the bold personality of a 
                                        particular character, consider bringing them along to the meeting to help woo the network.

                                        <li>: Keep shopping around your idea until you get a buyer. If one network isn’t interested in your idea, that doesn’t mean other 
                                        networks won’t be. Keep attending meetings and pitching your show. Take the feedback you get from network executives and TV 
                                        producers and use it to make your pitch package better.
