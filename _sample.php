       <h3 class="heading-tertiary-small">Synopsis: </h3><p class="view__paragraph">Gold Fever – Quest for the Mother Lode is a formatted reality competition, and arc series consisting of 12 episodes. 
           The format reveals an adventurous and intensely competitive show, whereby the Prospectors and 49ers teams are challenged to resolve clues and overcome obstacles and difficult tasks. Many of which, 
           are common to those experienced during the Gold Rush of 1848 at Sutter’s Mill near Lake Tahoe, California. 
In their struggles, teams are faced with conflicts, make-or-break dilemmas and claiming gold nuggets (gold faux) by use of digs, ropes, pans, shovels and picks. Teams will follow treasure map clues, scuffle 
in their effort to lead a stubborn donkey and be challenged with wheeling big boulder carts over treacherous terrain. Teams are faced with the daunting obstacle of traversing a log over Snake Pit Ravine, and 
transporting their gold find by block and tackle. After having a drink at The Jack Shack, they may squeeze through Treasure Tunnel or slog their way in the Quick Sandy Pit, but for sure, they will engage in a
 Wild West shoot-out at Duel or Die Pass. 
The most promising Gold Fever candidates will be the male/female teams that possess great physical fitness and strength, are fast on their feet and have a high aptitude in resolving Gold Fever clues. Each week 
two teams compete to stake their claim to the most weight in gold faux nuggets and advance to the next round.</p> 

<h3 class="heading-tertiary-small">Competition Format</h3>  
<p class="view__paragraph">The season begins with 12 qualifying competitors. Three male/female teams competing for the Prospectors and 49ers Divisions. Team members from both divisions draw names to decide who 
    the male/female pairings will be. After reviewing brief descriptions of weekly tasks, the team members decide which pairings are best fitted to compete in each week’s competition. All male/female teams compete twice during the first six weeks. 
In each week’s competition the course is unique and set with two or three tasks that include a combination of strenuous and difficult tasks, resolving clues and claiming gold nuggets. As teams run along a trail, they will approach a post with 
instructions that describe the objective of that task. During the competition teams will utilize many tools including picks, shovels, treasure maps, ropes, pans, screens, logs, block and tackles and boulder carts in the effort to complete their tasks. 
After the first team completes the course, their gold claim is deposited in a tin bucket. An assistant delivers the gold to the official weigh-in station while another assistant restores each obstacle and/or task and adds an equal number of gold 
nuggets to the same recovery spot based on the number of nuggets that were claimed by the first team. Therefore, the course is equally challenging with equal reward opportunities. 
</br></br>In Week 7 the teams gather for eliminations and social time; tossing horse shoes, roping and enjoying some grub. Prospectors and 49ers vote for the elimination of one of their teams. Members consider which two teams have the greatest chance 
to prevail in the weeks to come, then eliminates the weakest team.  In the elimination process, it can be anticipated that there will be some dissention, resentment and arguing among the team members. Order will need to be restored and ultimately, 
one team representing the Prospectors and 49ers divisions will be eliminated.  
Semi-final rounds in Weeks 8 and 9 will include two advancing teams from the Prospectors and the 49ers. Two teams from each division compete in Weeks 8 and 9 and the team claiming the most weight advances to the finale. Although the courses in 
Weeks 8 and 9 will have unique tasks, the weights in gold to be claimed will be identical. Before the competition starts, Prospectors and 49ers draw a number to determine which team will compete first. At the conclusion of Weeks 8 and 9 the gold 
claims are weighed and recorded. The results are placed in a sealed envelope and are held in secret until Week 10.</br></br> 
Week 10 is a time for team members to regroup and enjoy a social bonfire. Prospectors and 49ers convene for team eliminations and to witness the weigh-in of gold from the previous two weeks competitions. Drama builds as the team assemble for the 
weigh-in. The gold claims are weighed and the teams to represent the Prospectors and 49ers in the finale are announced. Also, at this time the accrued weight of gold for both divisions is tallied and announced.       
The highly anticipated finale extends through Week 11 and 12. </br></br>The teams representing the Prospectors and 49ers prepare to battle in a head-to-head competition. The two teams run along courses that are equal in clues, obstacles and weight in gold. 
At the end of the trail, and after a Wild West shoot-out the team claiming the most weight in gold wins the season’s competition. That team is declared the Greatest Gold Diggers of 2021 and secures the right to the final dig to claim the treasure trove of gold valued at $1,000,000. 
Production of the Gold Fever Competition </br></br>
There are many options to consider in the production of Gold Fever. It is estimated that the building of sets and filming may require as many as 5-7 acres. Production could be achieved at nearby fixed locations or at abandoned mining sites and ghost towns. 
The creator of this venture has personally viewed many potential filming locations in California, Nevada, Arizona and Colorado. 
Sutter’s Mill Mine near Lake Tahoe, California is the location where in 1848 gold was first discovered along the banks of the South Fork American River. Word of gold spread fast and the California Gold Rush was born. The Sutter’s Mill Mine can be leased for temporary use 
through the California State Lands Commission. The mine location, as a backdrop, coupled with existing buildings and gold mining machinery provides an excellent visual for production and would significantly reduce the cost of set construction.                                                                      
Qualifying Contestants</p> 
<p class="view__paragraph">Preceding the first season it will be necessary to qualify prospective team members. A good source of individuals could be procured through the vast pool of aspiring actors. These individuals will have interesting personal stories and a great 
    willingness to compete, while garnering professional exposure.                          
    <h3 class="heading-tertiary-small">Challenging Options to the Gold Fever Competition</h3></br>
Below, are 18 concepts of obstacles and tasks for inclusion to the competition. Considering a typical episode duration of 60 minutes it is likely that two or three tasks will fill the time slot. During each week’s elimination round contestants from the Prospectors and 49ers will 
compete on the same course. At each task there will be a post with instructions of the objective and the total count in number of gold nuggets at the site. Depending on the time to claim gold nuggets, teams may elect to recover less than the total to be sure they complete the course in the required time. 
At the conclusion of each episode the team’s gold is weighed and recorded.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-tertiary-small">Dilemma Junction – </h3><p class="view__paragraph">Team members run together and approach Dilemma Junction. On a post, are instructions to choose either Rattlesnake Gulch (.07km) that is partly flooded and has a shallow dig to recover a nugget of gold or fool’s gold, 
            OR choose Hangman’s Trail (50 yds.) that has a shallow dig to recover a small leather pouch with unknown contents. The team debates then runs on their trail of choice, not knowing if the dig site will yield the golden nugget. At dig sites, there are mining picks to use in reaching the “pay dirt” 
            where the treasure is found. {Only Hangman’s Trail possess the gold faux nugget}</p>

        <h3 class="heading-tertiary-small">Shoot-Out at Gunslinger’s Trail – </h3><p class="view__paragraph">While approaching along Gunslingers Trail to their mining shack, team members observe a picture of Billy the Kid and other outlaws on several Wanted signs posted by Federal Marshals. The sound of gun 
            fire is heard and intensifies as they draw closer. Three outlaws including the infamous Billy the Kid appear with pistols drawn and announce “We have come to steal your gold and claim our stake on these here gold reserves”. “And we do this by order of… Our Greedy Cause”. The team moves in to recover 
            three bags of gold and to kill the scoundrels. They prepare for a Wild West shoot-out with the entourage of outlaws. Both members take arms with protective gear and revolvers.
