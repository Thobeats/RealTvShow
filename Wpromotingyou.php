                    <p class="view__paragraph">
                        Behind every television program stands the writer, who with, creative imagination effects viable programming for the networks. 
                        Writers are the back bone of programming, that makes all TV entertainment possible.
                        Opportunity for writers is at the apex of growth for the 50+ broadcasting networks in the U.S. The growth of commercial 
                        television stations airing in the United States grew to a staggering 231% rate during the recent seven-year period.</br> 
                        The appetite for original TV programming has created intense competition between the networks. TV networks exhibit an insatiable 
                        desire to discover new material from writers who can appeal to audiences in the U.S. and abroad. 
                        While the opportunity for new writers is at its highest level, most production companies do not accept unsolicited material from 
                        individual writers. Having a literary agent and being affiliated with a known company with industry ties is nearly essential 
                        if your material is going to be read. Statistics confirm that individuals have a 93% Advantage to be read and discovered when 
                        being promoted by a 3rd. party business that specializes in the service of their needs.</br>
                        The RealityTVRegistry platform functions as a viable resource destination where Industry TV Producers and Executives review 
                        and discover unique formatted and docuseries programming. To encourage reviews of your material, registration is FREE to all 
                        industry TV producers and executives. We never collect a fee when options and/or contracts are executed between you and industry TV executives.
                        Securing Your Original Material</br>

                        to view the pitches that you submit to RealityTVRegistry. Please refer to the writer’s registration to view the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) 
                        that is required to be signed by industry professionals before they view your material. </br>

                                        All Industry TV executive registrations are closely vetted to insure, legitimacy before granting their access.
                                        After registering you can upload your pitch then have 24-hour access to edit or add other pitches. 
                                        When an executive reads your pitch, RTVR retains a record, and through your private account you are able to confirm the name and company of the individual who viewed your pitch and at the time and date of the viewing. 
                                        RealityTVRegistry extends two options to promote you and your material.
