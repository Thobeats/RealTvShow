                            Whether it is a relationship series, or competition series, it's all about creating the right elements that deliver key dramatic 
                            moments. Formatted programming delivers the unique premise and agenda for the series. The most important aspect of creating this type of series 
                            is to have a highly original hook that makes the show unlike anything we've seen. While the structure or subject may be derived from other popular 
                            shows, the new show has a specific hook that is captivating and elevates its uniqueness. This type of reality has diverse casting and unique

                            Reality TV is Programmed as either Formatted or Documentary Style Concepts
                            Formatted Reality displays very specific structure during the season’s episodes. It will rouse a dramatic and 
                            compelling competition, generally resulting in a team or single person prevailing. Competitive Formats including 
                            "Survivor", "Top Chef", "Wipe Out", and "The Bachelor" are typical examples of this type. Each consists of various 
                            structures and premise. One is ultimately about survival, while others are about cooking, stunts, and romance and 
                            relationships. 
                            These series follow a progressive path over the course of a season (an arc). "Wipe Out" is considered a self-contained 
                            format competition series. The first person to finish wins the show in each episode. Therefore, the series has self-contained 
                            episodes, with new contestants and challenges during each show. This type of reality has diverse casting and unique writing 
                            opportunities.

                            Format type reality shows are distinguished as either a "Self-Contained" or "Arc Series".
                            </br>
                            "Self-Contained" means that each episode has a defined structure and story that has a conclusion in each week. These formats do not carry over to the following week and therefore, Syndicators like this type of format because they can air any block of episodes without needing the audience to follow season long series. Reality Formats including "Fear Factor", "Extreme Makeover", "American Pickers", "Hotel Impossible", "Wife Swap" and "Undercover Boss" are but a few examples of self-contained series. This type of reality has diverse casting and unique writing opportunities.
                            </br>
                            “Arc Series" formats may be viewed by audiences that see a single episode as rather conclusive in its self. However, the overall experience of an Arc Series will be that of the many episodes during the season that ultimately conclude with a winner, or revelation. 
                            A most popular Arc Series, "Survivor" is a good example, in that each episode is infused with challenges participants face to win immunity, along with personal conflicts and strategies used between participants.  The progressive path of the episodes, evolve with the elimination of contestants. This type of reality has diverse casting and unique writing opportunities.
