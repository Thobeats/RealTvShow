                        The Formatted Reality TV type series exhibits a very clear structure, rules, and a progression to an ultimate
                        winner. Whether it is a relationship series, or competition series, it&#39;s all about creating the right elements that
                        deliver key dramatic moments. Formatted programming delivers the unique premise and agenda for the series.
                        The most important aspect of creating this type of series is to have a highly original hook that makes the show
                        unlike anything we&#39;ve seen. While the structure or subject may be derived from other popular shows, the new
                        show has a specific hook that is captivating and elevates its uniqueness. This type of reality has diverse
