It also delivers specific notifications of member related news. Our staff manually sends all emails to those registered with our promotional services. We do not spam non-members. Registered members submit either a personal or business email address that is used to receive notifications from our office. We pledge to never sale, lend or exploit member emails or other personal data to third parties.

                        <b class="paintme"> User Activity Monitored Password</b> protected access is provided to member writers. Thus, these members have access to <b class="paintme"> a personal project status page</b> where they are enabled to observe registered member executive reviews. The reviews are accessed for member writer related projects that are posted for review strictly for the access of the RTVR industry executive database. As registered industry executive examines or selects an applicable status for any project, that review/status is electronically sent and posted to the corresponding writer's project status page.  The information indicates the company name/ project title / date reviewed / and time. Industry executives have full discretion to select the status or the ability to change it at any time for any project that has been posted. The executive has no obligation to the corresponding writer. The review status logs are submitted to our registered member writers as a courtesy and service, and not to be construed as a right of information.

                        <p class="view__paragraph">
                        It is highly recommended that all member writers of RealityTVRegistry who submit original written material 
                        take the initiative to register for copyright protection. Your written material is considered intellectual property 
                        and it is ultimately the responsibility of the Writer to take these measures in protecting their work.
                        </br>

                        To provide mutual protection and privacy of both industry executives and registered writers, we require all registering 
                        industry executives to agree by electronic signature to an industry standard Non-Disclosure Agreement. Furthermore, 
                        all registered writers are required to agree by electronic signature, to an industry standard Material Release Form.
                        </p>

                        login information through a user's browser. A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive

                        The RealityTVRegistry registration form requires users to provide contact information including name, email address, and 
                        additional information. Our staff gathers customer contact information from the registration form to deliver user information 
                        about our company as well as information concerning available projects and other acquisition related data. The member's 
                        contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary.
                        </br>

                        Industry executives have the ability to contact registered members of RTVR to discuss their talent interests and projects, 
                        therefore it is important that member contact data are current. If the RTVR member enlists an industry representative it is 
                        imperative to so state and include the current contact data of the representative. *Writer contact information is not publicly 
                        displayed on RTVR platform. Contact information is only released to a verified Industry Executive when a formal solicitation or 
                        formal review of the talent or project is requested by the executive. At that time the executive may discuss project particulars 
                        or a deal proposal. The executives and/or staff of RTVR may contact any member as deemed necessary.
                        </br>

                        Therefore, RTVR cannot be held liable for the privacy practices or the content of these websites. The RTVR staff and executives 
                        pledge to never sell, broker or otherwise distribute mailing lists, contact information or personal demographics information to
